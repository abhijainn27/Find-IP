# Find-IP
A shell script to easily find IP if connected over wifi.

This Script saves your time by providing you the IP at the instant. So that you dont have to run ifconfig and search for the IP Address manually.
It also provides you the Broadcasr Address and Mask being used.

#How-to-Use
Just copy the findip.sh shell file in your home folder.
Now open Terminal and just type ./findip.sh

Bingo !! Your IP address would be there on your screen.

Note : It works only for Wifi. If you are connected over ethernet then it will show you the prompt again without any output.
       You can change the file to make it work for ethernet as well.
